# FAKINGIT - A TOOL TO JUST RANDOMLY CALL WEBSITES ON RANDOM SERVERS
#
# IF ENOUGH PPL WOULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, THIS COULD SERIOUSLY MESS UP
# ANY PATTERN SURVILLANCE WITHOUT REAL CLUES WHERE THE REAL USE OF FINDING
# SERIOUS CRIMINALITY WOULD STAY THE SAME
#
# FREE SOFTWARE ! USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK ETC.ETC.ETC.
