?? WHAT IS fakingIt

FakingIt is a Random-URL-Visitor in Python. A helpless, yet fearsome way of showing protest against the German Vorratsspeicherung


IF ENOUGH PPL WOULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, THIS COULD SERIOUSLY MESS UP
ANY PATTERN SURVILLANCE WITHOUT REAL CLUES WHEREAS THE REAL USE OF FINDING
SERIOUS CRIMINALITY WOULD STAY THE SAME !!!

FREE SOFTWARE ! USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK ETC.ETC.ETC.

1. This is still not Python 3, shame on me !

2. You will have to use pip to install the requests module under Windows
